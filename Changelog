LeafSOCdisplay changelog

   V49 - 20 May 2021
   Store MAX_GIDS variable in EEPROM and made it adjustable via the Climate Contols in the Leaf
   Store km_per_kWh variable in EEPROM and made it adjustable via the Climate Contols in the Leaf

   V47 - 16 May 2021
   Cleaned out the code for changing pages by a push button - hoping it would improve initial CAN data loading but it doesn't :(
   mMaybe the slow start is due to a clash between the MCP2515 and U8g2lib? Could switch to using Adafruit GFX lib instead. 
   (My RangePlot project uses the Adafruit library.)

   V46 - 16 May 2021
   Cleaned out the code for test-mode - I'm not using it anymore so it's just cruft

   V45 - 10 May 2021
   Changed to using 1.30inch OLED 128x64 display which uses the SH1106 driver. The u8G2 connector for the old SSD1306 driver 
   is commented out. If you want to use one of those diaplays simply comment out the SH1106 connector and un-comment the SSD1306 line.

   V44 - 25 Apr 2021
   Minor visual tweaks (moved text down on Page 3, and fixed kWh number alignment)

   V43 - 17 Apr 2021
   Added Page 3: Range page that fills display
   Added Page 4: Range page and small battry SOC% (repaces the crude data dump page)

   V42 - 16 Sept 2020
   Cleaning code before uploading to Github

   V41 - 28 Aug 2020
   Cleaning out old experimental junk
   added ability to change page by: (1) Put Climate Control On, Recirc Air,
   then change fan speed to change pages, Full fan speed -> Reset Arduino

22 Oct 2019
* renamed variables SOC -> rawGids, SOCPct -> GidsPct, MAX_SOC -> MAX_GIDS, ActSoc -> rawSOC, ActSocPct -> SOCPct
* refactored SOC so that 8 Gids = 0% up to MAX-GIDS - 8 = 100%. This means 0% occurs at turtle mode and 100% when the battery is full

10 Oct 2019
* rewrote the display sections to work with a 128x64 OLED display, using the U8G2 lib
* using the display upsidedown so that the wires come down from the bottom 

1 Oct 2019
* Started project from https://ev-olution.yolasite.com/CANa.php
* Starting code https://ev-olution.yolasite.com/resources/CANa_Display/CANa_Ver01.ino
