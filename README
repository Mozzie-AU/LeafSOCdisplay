LeafSOCdisplay
==============

This project adds a SOC% display to a Nissan Leaf. This useful for 2011 and 2012 Leafs which did not include thios feature!

The first generation Leafs did not show the battery State of Charge accurately on the dash. There's the 12 blue bars on the 
right by the range estimate but that's all. After 2012 they added a SOC% feature to the main dash. This project replicates 
that feature.

Most people just use the LeafSpy app on a phone to address this shortcoming. In my case the phone I was using stopped 
connecting to the Bluetooth dongle I had. I also didn't like faffing about with a phone to get this basic information. 
The phone needs to be mounted on the dash, it needs to be kept charged, and the user interface on LeafSpy isn't great.

So my goal is to have a SOC display integrated into the dash with no extra fiddling about. It should just turn on when the 
car does and require zero effort on my part.

This project is based on the CANa Display for Nissan LEAF project which is beautifully simple and straightforward. All I've 
done is change the code to make it work with a nice OLED display that will fit inside the eyebrow dash. It is powered by the 
OBD2 port in such a way that it only works when the car is turned on. [Note: the dongles that are used with LeafSpy run 
24/7 unless you manually turn them off - which is a security risk.]

Hardware
--------
These parts are available from Aliexpress, Amazon, EBay, TradeMe, Banggood, etc.
* 10-16V to 5V DC-DC step down Buck converter
* NiRen MCP2515_CAN bus board 8MHz
* Arduino Pro Mini 328, 5V/16MHz version [I used a CH340 UART Serial Converter Cable to program the Arduino. 
  Alternatively you could use a Arduino Pro Micro which has built in USB communications)
* OLED display 128x64 pixel 1/3 inch monochrome OLED display
* OBD2 plug (male)
* 7-way ribbon cable
* 40 Pin 2.54 mm Right Angle Single Row Pin Header Male
* Dupont-style jumper wires
* a plastic box to house the electronic bits

Optional:
* OBD2 Splitter Extension Cable

Circuit description
-------------------
Power for the system is provided from the OBD2 port - pin 4 (ground) and pin 8 (switched +12 from battery). Note pin 8
is a switched +12 on the Leaf. The OBD2 standard power is on pin 16 - but it's always on 24/7.

The power goes straight into a step down module that provides 5V for everything; the MCP2515_CAN, the Arduino Pro Mini 
and the OLED display.

The Leaf EV-CAN signals come via OBD2 pins 12 and 13. The OBD2 standard CAN bus signals are on pins 6 and 14 - which, 
in the case of the Leaf gives the Car-CAN bus.

The EV-CAN signals go into the MCP2515_CAN module - which is connected to the Arduino via 5-wire SPI.


Installation
------------
I chose to install the OLED display over the top of the efficiency trees on the Leaf's "eyebrow" dash. The trees don't 
serve a critical function so it's no great loss. I stuck a piece of wide black electrical tape over the trees, then 
used double sided tape to stick the OLED display onto the black tape. (Note: electrical tape is usually easy to remove 
so you could remove all this if you needed to.)

To install the display inside the dash you'll need to remove the dash and unclip the clear plastic front. See Nissan 
Leaf Instrument Cluster Removal for an explanation of how to remove the dash.

I also used a craft knife to trim 1mm off edge of the dash to allow the 7-wire ribbon cable to exit cleanly. Clip the
dash front back on thread the ribbon cable down past the lower dash.

Next you'll want to remove the lower dash panel, see Nissan Leaf 020 - ETC replacement options. Once that's open you 
can attach the OLED ribbon to the Arduino and zip-tie the electronic modules (in a plastic box maybe) somewhere where 
they won't rattle and then connect the OBD2 plug to the socket.
